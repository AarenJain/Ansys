This project involves the design and simulation of a 3D antenna structure using ANSYS HFSS (High-Frequency Structure Simulator). The objective is to analyze the antenna's performance parameters, including S-parameters, Z-parameters, and realized gain. The project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of HFSS in designing antennas suitable for high-frequency applications.
